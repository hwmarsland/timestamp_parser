# timestamp_parser

I created this program to take the output of another program that went through a database and pulled the last time every file was accessed and split it into sections to increase the readability. 

Note: The filepath for each folder was listed on its own and then the contents of the folder were listed below. I took this and copied it into another column, matching with the files, which greatly increased readability and allowed the files to be sorted by the date they were last opened.
